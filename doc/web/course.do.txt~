The teaching material is produced in various formats for printing and on-screen reading.
If you are not familiar with second quantization, we recommend that you go through the additional material included here.

The PDF files are based on LaTeX and have seldom technical
failures that cannot be easily corrected.
The HTML-based files, called ``HTML'' and ``ipynb'' below, apply MathJax
for rendering LaTeX formulas and sometimes this technology gives rise
to unexpected failures (e.g.,
incorrect rendering in a web page despite correct LaTeX syntax in the
formula). Consult the corresponding PDF
files if you find missing or incorrectly rendered
formulas in HTML or ipython notebook files.
